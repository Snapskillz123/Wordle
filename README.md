# Wordle

My code for the popular word game Wordle which My friends and I created for a school project.

The code is written in Python using [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) library for GUI.

The database of words has been acquired online and accessed through MySQL.

Directories need to be changed according to where you save it on your system.
